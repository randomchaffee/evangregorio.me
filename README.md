## Project Overview

This project is a FastAPI backend deployed on an **AWS EC2** instance running Ubuntu 24.04 and connected to a **PostgreSQL** database.  
I'm working on this as a prototype for a future project and for learning **cloud deployment**, **backend development**, and **database integration**.

The API is live and accessible via the web. You can test endpoints directly in your browser or with tools like Postman.

Currently in early early experimentation phase.

## Live Server

You can also access the interactive API docs (Swagger UI) directly:

## Notes

- The API is running behind Nginx with HTTPS provided by Certbot.
- The API is served via Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers.
- The service runs inside Docker containers
- PostgreSQL data is persisted using Docker volumes

## Deployment Automation

- Pushes to `main` trigger GitHub Actions deployment.
- Backend deploy uses `docker compose up -d --build` on EC2.
- Root website files from `evangregorio.me/` are synced to `/var/www/evangregorio.me`.
- Nginx config is tested (`nginx -t`) and reloaded after sync.
- Legacy systemd-only deploy flow is deprecated for this repo.
